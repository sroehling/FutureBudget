# Loan Origination

Loan origination parameters include the following:

* __Origination Date__ - When the loan was originated or is expected to originate. For existing loans, enter a date in the past. A future date is used for loans expected to originate in the future.
* __Amount Borrowed__ - If the loan originated in the past, enter the actual amount borrowed. If the __Origination Date__ is in the future, the amount borrowed will typically be entered as a current value, and the __Amount Borrowed Growth Rate__ is used to adjust the amount borrowed for inflation.
* __Amount Borrowed Growth Rate__ - This setting is only for loans which have an __Origination Date__ in the future. This growth rate adjusts for inflation the amount borrowed until the future origination date.
* __Interest Rate__ - Yearly interest rate charged for the loan.
* __Duration__ - Starting with the __Origination Date__, how long it will take to payoff the loan (notwithstanding extra payments or an early payoff).
