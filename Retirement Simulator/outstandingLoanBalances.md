# Outstanding Loan Balances

An [loan][2]'s outstanding balance provides a "snapshot" of the loan balance as 
of the [start date][1] of the simulation. If the origination date of the loan 
is before the [simulation start date][1], the outstanding loan balance represents
the balance as of this start date. However, if the origination date is 
after the simulation start date (e.g., for an loan you plan to take in the future), 
an outstanding balance is not needed.
