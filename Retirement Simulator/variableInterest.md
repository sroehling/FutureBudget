# Variable Interest Rate

Interest rates can remain [fixed][1] or change over time. Variable [loan][2] interest rates 
are used when the interest rate is expected
to change over time. 

Even if the interest rate isn't 
expected to change over time, variable interest rates can 
also be used to setup a list of common values
which can be easily selected in different [scenarios][3].
