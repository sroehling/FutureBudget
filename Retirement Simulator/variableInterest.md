## Variable Interest Rate

Interest rates can remain [fixed][fixedInterest] or change over time. Variable [loan][loan] interest rates 
are used when the interest rate is expected
to change over time. For example, a variable interest rate can be used for an adjustable rate mortgage (ARM) used to [purchase a new home][exampleHomeOwnership].

If a loan's interest rate changes, the monthly payment is recalculated starting with the first payment after the interest change. The new payment is based upon the new interest rate, the outstanding balance, and the number of remaining payments.

Variable interest rates can 
also be used to setup a list of common values
which can be easily selected in different [scenarios][scenario]. For example, if a number of different adjustable (variable) and fixed rate mortgage rates are under consideration for a home mortgage, different variable interest rates could be setup for each different rate.
