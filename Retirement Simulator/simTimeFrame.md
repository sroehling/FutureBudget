# Simulation Time Frame

The __Start Date__ and __Stop Date__ are dates the simulation will start and stop. 
If the start date is changed, the [current balances][1], [current asset values][2], 
[outstanding loan balances][3], and [deficit balance][4] should also be 
updated to reflect their values as of the start date.
