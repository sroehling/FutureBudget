# Variable Return Rate

An account input's return/interest rate can remain [fixed][fixedReturn] or change over time. 
Variable return rates are used when the return rate is expected
to change over time, or shared by different inputs. 

For example, if an investment account's expected rate of return is higher 
before than after retirement, a variable return rate could be used to 
lower the expected rate of return after the planned retirement date. 
Similarly, if the interest rate for a regular savings account is 
low today, but expected to increase in the future, a variable rate could be used.

Even if the return rate isn't 
expected to change over time, variable return rates can  be used to setup 
a list of common return rates,
which can be easily selected in different [scenarios][scen].
