## Tax Rates

A tax input's tax rates are the percentages of taxes paid for the income amounts
associated with input's [tax sources][taxSource]. 

A tax bracket with a single entry and a cutoff amount of $0 will result in the same percentage
being used for all amounts. This type of tax bracket can be used to
represent a "flat tax" or an effective tax rate.  

A tax bracket with multiple entries allows different percentages to be used for different amounts.
For example, a progressive income tax includes higher tax percentage for larger taxable incomes.

When creating tax inputs, some presets are provided with different examples of tax brackets.
