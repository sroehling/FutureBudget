# Deficit

If at any time, the amounts needed to pay expenses are greater than the cash balance
and balances from account withdrawals, a deficit will be accumulated, and interest 
will accrue on this balance. If there is a deficit balance, and the income again
exceeds the expenses, the deficit will be paid down before accruing a positive cash balance.

A __Current Deficit__ can also be set to indicate how much deficit there is at the 
__Start Date__ of simulation. A current deficit would be appropriate for any outstanding revolving credit balances,
such as credit cards.
