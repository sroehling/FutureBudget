# Self Contained User Guide

A self-contained version of the help files can be generated using the following:

	../../MarkdownHelpGeneration/genSelfContained.pl selfContainedUserGuideFileList.txt userGuideHeader.latex FutureBudgetUserGuide.pdf

This will concatenate all the help files into one PDF for purposes of posting a user guide on the app's website.

The file list selfContainedUserGuideFileList.txt is passed to this wrapper script. This list should be updated if new files are added. Notably, the last entry in the list is links_internal.md. This contains a list of links referenced from the help files themselves. Since the links are internal in the self-contained user guide file, they are setup as the header anchors as generated by Pandoc.
