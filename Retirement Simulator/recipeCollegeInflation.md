# Inflation of College Expenses

When a new [expense input][1] is first created, it has a __Yearly Increase__  which is the __Default Inflation Rate__. However, if for college related expenses, the assumption is the costs will grow at a different rate than the default inflation rate, a custom [variable growth rate][2] could be created for these expenses. For example, this variable growth rate could have a starting value which is higher than the default inflation rate, then lower over time as costs moderate.

Another possibility is to break down college into several expenses, and assign a different __Yearly Increase__ to each. For example, different expenses could be created for room and board versus tuition and a different __Yearly Increase__ could be associated with each.
