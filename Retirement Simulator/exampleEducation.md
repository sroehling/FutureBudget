## Education Examples

Along with [housingExample][housing] and transportation, education can be one of the most significant expenses. For example, education expenses may include private schools or kids' college educations.

### Breaking Down College Expenses

Similar to [monthly bills][expenseExample], you could start by entering a single yearly expense for college. The __Start Date__ would be set to the expected starting date of the first semester, and the amount would be expected cost for the year.

However, at some point, you may want to split college expenses into multiple inputs, such as:

* Tuition
* Room and Board
* Books and Supplies
* Travel to and from the school

With the expenses broken down, there is more flexibility to perform what-if analyses with different [scenarios][scenario]; for example:

* Live at home and commute to a local college: in this case, travel costs and room and board would be minimized.
* Attend an in-state than an out-of-state school. In this case, tuition and travel costs would likely be less.

After breaking down the college expenses into multiple inputs, a suggestion is to [tag][tags] all the college related inputs with a tag named "College" or similar. Then, if you want to focus on college related inputs, the input list can be filtered accordingly.

### College Tuition Inflation

When a new [expense input][expense] is first created, it has a __Yearly Increase__  which is the __Default Inflation Rate__. However, if for college tuition, the assumption is the costs will grow at a different rate than the default inflation rate, a custom [variable growth rate][variableInflation] could be created for these expenses. For example, this variable growth rate could have a starting value which is higher than the default inflation rate, then lower over time as costs moderate.
