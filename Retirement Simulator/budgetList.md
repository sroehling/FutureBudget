## Budget List

When the FutureBudget app first opens, a single "Master" budget is created. However, 
there are some reasons to create more than one budget, and switch between them as appropriate.

When you're first learning the app, you may want to create a "sandbox" budget to
learn how to use the app. FutureBudget keeps different budgets in different files, so
in this case, any changes made will not affect the main budget.

You may also want to create a "mini" budget to test 
some assumptions in isolation, such as for investing, college spending, or [purchasing a new car][exampleCarOwnership].
For example, if you're just thinking about purchasing a new car, and don't yet want the inputs to be part of your main budget, a separate mini-budget would be appropriate.

Finally, if you intend to help others with their budgeting, you could create a
budget which is separate from your own. For example, if you want to help a
family member who has separate finances with their budgeting, a separate budget is recommended.
