## Current Asset Values

An [asset][asset]'s current value provides a "snapshot" of the asset as of the
[start date][resultsTimeFrame] for calculating results. If the purchase date of the asset is before the [start date][resultsTimeFrame], 
the current value provides an estimate of the asset's value as of this start date. 
However, if the purchase date is after the start date 
(e.g., for an asset you plan to purchase in the future), a current value is not needed.
