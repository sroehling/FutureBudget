## Scenarios

Inputs can have different values for different scenarios. 
For example, an expense's __Amount__
can have a larger value by default, but a smaller value under an
alternate scenario for [reduced expenses][cuttingExpensesExample]. 

Under different scenarios, not only can values change, but inputs can be enabled and disabled altogether. For example, if you decide to [purchase a new car][exampleCarOwnership] with cash instead of a money from a loan, the loan input could be disabled.

### Default Scenario

The default scenario represents the inputs' expected
values. This scenario serves also  serves 
as a starting  point or "baseline" for changes made under alternate 
scenarios. There is only one default scenario.

### Alternate Scenarios

Alternate scenarios are a good way to try different values and address "what if" questions. For example, an alternate scenario could be created for [early retirement][exampleEarlyRetirement], [cutting expenses][cuttingExpensesExample] with more frugal budgeting, or different ways to [pay for][collegeExpensesExample] and/or attend college.

If a value is set while an alternate scenario is selected, the value is only changed for the alternate scenario; in other words, changing the value under the alternate scenario will not change the value for the default scenario. If a value is not set for an alternate scenario, the value for the default scenario is used. Any number of alternate scenarios can be created. 
 
### Input Values and Scenarios 

When inputs are first created, the inputs' values are saved
under the default scenario.  Thereafter, changes to inputs 
are saved under the currently selected scenario. 

If values are changed under an alternate scenario, these values can be 
viewed or changed by opening up a detailed view of the scenario
from the scenario list in the __What If__ tab. 

The currently selected scenario also determines which set of values
will be used in the results. A way to compare scenarios is to 
go to the scenario list in the __What If__ tab, then toggle
back and forth to the __Forecast__ tab with different scenarios
selected.
