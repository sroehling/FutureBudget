## Scenarios

Inputs can have different values for different scenarios. 
For example, an expense's __Amount__
can have a larger value by default, but a smaller value under an
alternate scenario for [reduced expenses][cuttingExpensesExample]. 
There are two types of scenarios:

### Default Scenario

The default scenario represents the inputs' expected
values. This scenario serves also  serves 
as a starting  point or "baseline" for changes made under alternate 
scenarios. There is only one default scenario.

### Alternate Scenarios

Alternate scenarios are a good way to try
different values and address "what if" questions. If a value is not
set for an alternate scenario, the value for the default scenario is used. 
Any number of alternate scenarios can be created. 
 
### Input Values and Scenarios 

When inputs are first created, the inputs' values are saved
under the default scenario.  Thereafter, changes to inputs 
are saved under the currently selected scenario. 

If values are changed under an alternate scenario, these values can be 
viewed or changed by opening up a detailed view of the scenario
from the scenario list in the __What If__ tab. 

The currently selected scenario also determines which set of values
will be used in the results. A way to compare scenarios is to 
go to the scenario list in the __What If__ tab, then toggle
back and forth to the __Results__ tab with different scenarios
selected.
