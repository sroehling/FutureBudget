# Milestone Date

Milestone dates are named dates which can be can be referenced and shared by 
multiple inputs. Changes to a milestone date 
will impact the results for all inputs which have selected the same milestone date.

Similarly, if different dates are under consideration for the same
input, several milestone dates can be created then set in
different [scenarios][scenario].

For example, a milestone date could be setup for a planned retirement date. 
Then, retirement related inputs, such as employment income, housing, 
or monthly expenses can reference this same milestone date. 
If early retirement is under consideration, a separate milestone date
would be setup for the expected early retirement date, then retirement related
inputs would be set to this milestone under an early retirement scenario.

As another example, if a loan will be taken for the future purchase 
of a new car or home, a milestone date could be 
created to give the loan origination and corresponding asset purchase the same date.
