## Cutting Expenses

Similar to the way expenses may increase or decrease with [retirement][1],
it may be useful to investigate how cutting back other types of 
expenses would affect long term results.

For example, instead of having a full price [wedding][2],
the wedding's size and cost could be reduced with the 
differece being saved. Or, instead of dining out for lunch 
several times a week, this expense could be trimmed and 
the difference being invested. Other expenses,
like a gym membership could be cut altogether.

### Instructions

For each expense that will be subject to a reduced amount, change
the expense as follows:

1. Select the __Inputs__ tab, and select the expense needing a change.

2. For this expense, select the __Amount__.

3. Tap the __Edit__ button to enable editing of the amount.

3. If a [single amount](fixedAmount.html) is selected, change the
   amount. Or, if a [variable amount](variableAmount.html) is selected, tap on 
   the variable amount to change the starting amount or changes which
   occur to the amount over time.
   
4. Tap the __Done__ button to save the changes.
