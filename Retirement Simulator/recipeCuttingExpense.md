## Cutting Expenses

Similar to the way expenses may increase or decrease with [retirement][1],
it may be useful to investigate how cutting back other types of 
expenses would affect long term results.

For example, instead of having a full price [wedding][2],
the wedding's size and cost could be reduced with the 
differece being saved. Or, instead of dining out for lunch 
several times a week, this expense could be trimmed and 
the difference being invested. Other expenses,
like a gym membership could be cut altogether.
