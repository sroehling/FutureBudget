## Early Retirement

### Create an "Early Retirement" Scenario

To make changes to input values without impacting
the default results, a new [alternate scenario][1] named "Early Retirement"
could first be created and selected as the current scenario. 

This scenario can be created by going to the scenario list in the 
__What If__ tab. Then select it as the current scenario, so further changes 
to input values will be saved under this scenario.

### Change the Stop Date for Income

The __Stop Date__ for income would be changed to reflect the early 
retirement date. To make this change, creating and selecting 
a [milestone date][2] named "Early Retirement" is suggested.

To make this change, do the following:

1. Go to the __Inputs__ tab

2. Select the appropriate income input. 

3. Select this input's __Stop Date__. 

4. Tap the __Edit__ button.

5. While in edit mode, tap the ![add milestone][5] button to create the new "Early Retirement" milestone date.

6. When done creating the milestone date, tap the __Done__ button.

7. Select this new milestone date instead of the default retirement date.
