# Input Tags

Input tags are a convenient way to organize and work with inputs. Inputs can be assigned multiple tags. For example:

  * A "Discretionary" tag for expenses which could be trimmed in a more frugal budget.
  * "College Related" for loans, expenses and savings accounts related to college.
  * "Changes with Retirement" for incomes, expenses and accounts related to retirement.
  * "New Car" for the loan, asset purchase and extra expenses related to a new car.
  
In general, it is useful to put the same tag on inputs expected to change together. The input list can then be filtered to only show inputs with specific tags. This facilitates making changes to inputs with the same tag, since the unrelated inputs are not shown.
