# Setting up for Results Generation

The values listed in the __Startup__ tab provide a timeframe for results generation and a snapshot of balances as of the start date of this timeframe. In particular, these values provide a snapshot of [account][currentBal], [loan][outstandingLoanBal], [cash][cash], and [deficit][deficit] balances. For any assets, the current [asset values][currentAssetVals] are also provided. Finally, there are values to determine how results are [adjusted for expected  inflation][inflationAdjustment].

After adding inputs for incomes, expenses, etc., values in the __Startup__ tab should also be reviewed then updated as needed.
