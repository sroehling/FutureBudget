## Variable Growth Rate

Growth rates can remain fixed or change over time. Variable growth rates 
are used when the growth rate is expected
to change over time, or shared by different inputs. 

For example, if the expected growth rates for [college][collegeExpensesExample] or health care expenses 
are expected to be high for the next few years, then lower thereafter, a variable
 growth rate could be used to represent this change over time.

Even if the growth rate isn't 
expected to change over time, variable growth rates can 
also be used to setup a list of common values
which can be easily selected in different [scenarios][scenario]. 
There is also a __Default Inflation Rate__, which is the default for most growth rates.
