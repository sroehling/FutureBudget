# Roth IRA Account

A Roth IRA account is an account where after tax contributions
are made into the account, the interest (or investment returns) accrue
tax free, and withdrawals are tax free. An [account input][1]
Roth IRA account.

The [current balance][2], interest rate and contributions for this type
of are configured like any other account. 

What makes a Roth IRA account
unique is contributions are made with after tax income, but
withdrawals are tax free. Assuming [income inputs][8], such as [employment income][5], 
are already setup
as [tax sources][3] for appropriate [tax inputs][4], contributions
to the Roth IRA will occur with after-tax income. Since withdrawals
are tax free, there is nothing else to setup with respect to taxes.

Using the __Defer Withdrawals__ setting in the [account input][1], Roth IRA 
accounts can also be configured with deferred withdrawals. A [milestone date][5] 
can also be setup for the deferred withdrawal date; such a milestone date
could be shared by other accounts, such as [401Ks][6] or other Roth IRAs.

While deferred withdrawals determine when withdrawals can occur from an account,
the [withdrawal priority][7] setting determines the relative order in which withdrawals
will occur amongst different accounts.
