## Variable Appreciation

Appreciation rates for Assets can remain [fixed][fixedApprec] or change over time. Variable
appreciation (or depreciation) rates are used when the appreciation is expected
to change.

For example, a variable appreciation rate could be used for a car purchase, 
which is expected to depreciate quickly in the first couple years of ownership, 
then depreciate slowly thereafter. Even if the appreciation rate isn't 
expected to change over time, variable appreciation rates can 
also be used to setup a list of named values
which can be quickly selected in different [scenarios][scenario].
