## Expense Examples

For regular monthly expenses, like utilities, groceries, gasoline, cell phone service, etc., an [expense input][expense] represents the amount of money spent for these expenses.

### Starting with Combined Expenses

When first starting to use the app, one recommendation is to combine all monthly expenses into a single expense input called "Monthly Bills" or similar. The amount on this expense would be equal to the sum total of all the expenses it represents.

When and if you decide to perform what-if analyses with the individual expenses, This combined expense can later be split into individual expenses. For example, to see the impact over time of eating out less, you could create a separate "Dining Out" expense and change its amount under a different [scenario][scenario]. 

### Irregular Expenses

Expense inputs are not limited to repeating monthly expenses. They can be used for one-time expenses, expenses in the future, or expenses which occur once per year, such as:

* Weddings in the future.
* Payments for college tuition.
* Summer vacations.
* Holiday gifts.

### Cutting Expenses

Similar to the way expenses may increase or decrease with [retirement][retirementExample], it may be interesting to investigate how cutting back other types of expenses would affect long term results.

For example, instead of having a full price wedding, the wedding's size and cost could be reduced with the difference being saved. Or, instead of dining out for lunch several times a week, this expense could be trimmed and the difference being invested. Other expenses, like a gym membership could be cut altogether.

To make changes to input values without impacting the default results, a new [alternate scenario][alternateScenario] named "Cutting Expenses" could first be created and selected as the current scenario. 

This scenario can be created by going to the scenario list in the __What If__ tab. Then select it as the current scenario, so further changes to input values will be saved under this scenario.

For each expense that will be subject to a reduced amount, change the expense as follows:

1. Select the __Inputs__ tab, and select the expense needing a change.

2. For this expense, select the __Amount__.

3. Tap the __Edit__ button to enable editing of the amount.

3. If a [single amount][fixedAmount] is selected, change the amount. Or, if a [variable amount][variableAmount] is selected, tap on the variable amount to change the starting amount or changes which occur to the amount over time.
   
4. Tap the __Done__ button to save the changes.


After identifying expenses which can be cut, a suggestion is to [tag][tags] the corresponding [expense inputs][expense] with a tag named "Cuttable Expenses" or similar. Then, if you want to review and change the amounts associated with these inputs, the input list can be filtered accordingly.
