# Inflation of Health Care Costs

When a new [expense input][1] is first created, it has a __Yearly Increase__  which is the __Default Inflation Rate__. However, if for health care related expenses, the assumption is costs will grow at a different rate than the default inflation rate, a custom [variable growth rate][2] could be created for these expenses. For example, this variable growth rate could have a starting value which is higher than the default inflation rate, then lower over time as costs moderate.
