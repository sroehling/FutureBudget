# Getting Started

Basically, the steps to work with FinSim include:

1. In the **Inputs** tab, make a list of incomes, expenses and other inputs 
   matching your current and future financial assumptions.
2. Select the **Startup** tab to review (and update, if necessary) the starting 
   (current) balances for accounts and loans. This tab also includes a timeframe to 
   generate results and whether or not to adjust results for expected inflation.
3. Select the **Results** tab to see a number of charts and tables showing 
   forecasted financial results over time.

The steps above would be repeated as new inputs are added or existing ones are changed. Consistent with the 
steps outlined above, below are more specific suggestions for getting started.

## Start with Simplifying Assumptions and Basic Inputs 

When first getting started, a recommendation is to start with some more general inputs, rather than a long list of detailed inputs. For example, a single 'Monthly Living Expenses' expense input can be created instead of splitting into individual expenses such as groceries, utilities, or gasoline.

Many budgeting scenarios can also be initially represented with only basic [income][income] and [expense][expense] inputs. For example, rather than initially splitting employment income based upon all the different taxes and employment related benefits, a single "Take Home Pay" expense can be created.

These approaches allow you to get some results quickly, but continue to dig deeper and add more details later. This is also a good way to become familiar with the app's basic functions.

## More Advanced Inputs and Features

Besides making a list of inputs and generating results, a number of other features
are useful. For example:

* [Scenarios][scenario] - make isolated changes to inputs'
for a different/alternate set of assumptions (such as early retirement, 
online instead of residential college education).  
* **What If** tab - change related values across multiple inputs, such as expense amounts or 
investment accounts' growth rates.
* [Tags][tags] - Group related inputs so their values can be reviewed and changed together. 

The app also supports more advanced inputs, such as [assets][asset], [loans][loan], and [accounts][account] for savings or investments. For greater detail, multiple inputs can be used. For example, a home purchase could be represented by loan (mortgage), asset, and expense inputs.

Along with different input types, there are numerous and flexible ways to configure these inputs. For example, if you expect to drive less after retirement, using a [variable amount][variableAmount], an expense for gasoline could be reduced after your expected retirement date.

Finally, after populating the FutureBudget with inputs, "what if" scenarios can be evaluated by changing inputs under a specific [scenario][scenario]. For example, a scenario could be used to evaluate sending your kids away for college versus living at home and attending college online.

The recommendations for inputting [common examples][inputExamples] also provide suggestions formore advanced usage by splitting into multiple inputs, [scenarios][scenario], [tags][tags], and [variable amounts][variableAmount].
