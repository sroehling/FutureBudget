## Tax Sources

To specify where the taxes come from, a tax input needs to be linked with other inputs.
The amounts subject to taxes can include incomes, savings interest, 
asset sales, taxable withdrawals, or investment gains.

Along with the tax input's [tax rate][taxRate] and any [deductions][taxDeduction], [credits][taxCredit],
or [adjustments][taxAdjustments], the sum total of amounts from all tax sources
is used in the calculation of the taxes paid.
