# Tax Input Presets

When creating a [tax input][tax], there is an option to start with an uninitialized tax input, or one of the presets. The presets will pre-populate the tax bracket with the appropriate tax rate(s). If the blank tax input is created, the tax bracket will initially be empty and you'll need to populate the tax bracket yourself.

After creating the tax input, you will still need to link the tax input with other inputs for which the tax applies. For example, the newly created tax input could be linked with an [income input][income] as a source of taxable income, or with an [expense][expense] which is deductable.
