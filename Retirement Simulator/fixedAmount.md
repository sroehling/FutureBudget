# Single Amount

Select this amount for an amount that is not expected to change over time, except for regular inflation. When a new input is created, a single amount is selected as the default. For example, a single amount should be used for inputs, such as [regular monthly expenses][1] or [employment income][2].

Separate from this amount, a __Yearly Increase__ is supported, which is a percentage to adjust the amount for inflation and/or normal increases. 

To change the amount, tap on the __Edit__ button, make the change, then tap on the __Done__ button to commit the change.
