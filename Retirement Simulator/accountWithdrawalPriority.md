## Account Withdrawal Order

Relative to (versus) other accounts, an account's withdrawal order determines the order in which money 
will be withdrawn from accounts to pay expenses. 

Accounts with a lower order (listed higher in the list) will be withdrawn from before 
accounts with a higher order (listed lower in the list).

For example, an escrow account for irregular expenses may be ordered higher than a long term or 
emergency savings account.
