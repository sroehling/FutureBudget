## Forecast Time Frame

Forecast results will be calculated between the __Start Date__ and __Stop Date__.

The values for [account balances][currentBal], [loan balances][outstandingLoanBal], [asset values][currentAssetVals] and the [cash balance][cash] should
be entered as of the start date. So, if the start date is changed, 
the [current balances][currentBal], [current asset values][currentAssetVals], 
[outstanding loan balances][outstandingLoanBal], and [deficit balance][deficit] should also be 
updated to reflect their values as of the start date.

Choosing a start date at the beginning of the year is recommended, since this 
will ensure results for the first year are comparable with following years.
