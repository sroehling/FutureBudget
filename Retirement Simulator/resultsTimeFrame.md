# Results Time Frame

Results will be calculated between the __Start Date__ and __Stop Date__.

The values for account balances, loan balances, asset values and the cash balance should
be entered as of the start date. So, if the start date is changed, 
the [current balances][1], [current asset values][2], 
[outstanding loan balances][3], and [deficit balance][4] should also be 
updated to reflect their values as of the start date.

Choosing a start date at the beginning of the year is recommended, since this 
will ensure results for the first year are comparable with following years.
