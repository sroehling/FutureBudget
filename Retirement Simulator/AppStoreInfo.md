## Description

FutureBudget is a flexible and relatively general purposes financial planning tool for longer term budgeting, forecasting and "what if" analyses. It will help you gain insights into and critically think about your finances, while learning about the time-value of money, keeping up with inflation, positive cash flow, and other important concepts.

• No "canned inputs" - input any combination of incomes, expenses, assets, loans, investment or savings accounts, and taxes. These inputs are flexible "building blocks" matching your unique assumptions.
• Detailed forecasts - with over a dozen different forecast results, evaluate how your assumptions play out over time and with expected inflation.
• Not limited to retirement planning - with flexible inputs and multiple budgets (plans), FutureBudget also supports planning for college expenses, purchasing a new home and the like.
• Multiple scenarios - make changes to input values separately from the main/baseline scenario.
• "What if" views - review and change related input parameters together.

For more information, examples, and an informative slideshow, be sure to visit the app's web site.
