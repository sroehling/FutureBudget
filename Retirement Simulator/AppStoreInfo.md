## Description

FutureBudget will help you plan for your financial future by flexibly evaluating different longer term budgeting and investing what-if scenarios. 

While most financial planning/budgeting apps are based on more general or "canned" inputs, FutureBudget works with specific assumptions about both current and future incomes, expenses and investments. By supporting specific inputs, FutureBudget flexibly supports many types of scenarios; for example:

• After retirment, lower the expected return rate for an investment portfolio.
• Future one-time expenses or incomes, such as a wedding or new car purchase.
• Different growth/inflation rates for certain expenses, such as college or health insurance.
• Send the kids to public or private schools.
• After the kids move out or you retire, lower certain household expenses.
* What will happen if salary increases don't keep up with expected inflation?
• Have a little fun - what would happen if you got an unexpected inheritance from a long lost uncle?

Formulating specific inputs for FutureBudget will not only prompt some critical thinking about your financial future, but FutureBudget will also be able to generate results which are relavent and throught provoking. Changes to some inputs may have little impact on the results, while a 1 or 2 percent change in expected investment returns could dramatically impact long term results.

Features: 

• Multiple Scenarios - make changes to input values separately from the main/baseline scenario. 
• "What if" views to review and change related input values together.
• Variable values - increase or decrease values over time, such as investment returns or expenses.
• Passcode to limit who can open the app.
