## Variable Amount

Amounts used with inputs can either be configured to remain fixed
(except for inflation), or to change over time.

A variable amount is used if the value needs to change over time. 
Even if the amount isn't expected to change over time, variable 
amounts can also be used to setup a list of named values
which can be quickly selected from in different [scenarios][scenario].
