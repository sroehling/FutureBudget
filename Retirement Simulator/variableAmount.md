## Variable Amount

Amounts used with expenses, incomes, account contributions, extra loan payments, and other inputs can be fixed or change over time.

A growth rate is associated with each amount, which allows the amount to adjust by a percentage for expected inflation, contribution increases, cost of living increases, etc. However, a variable amount can also be used if the amount otherwise needs to change over time. For example, some expenses may [decrease after retirement][exampleRetirementReduceExpenses], such as gasoline for commuting. Similarly, the amount for [employment income][employmentIncomeExample] may reduce to zero after retirement.

Even if the amount isn't expected to change over time, variable 
amounts can also be used for a list of named amounts. These named amounts can then be quickly selected from in different [scenarios][scenario].
