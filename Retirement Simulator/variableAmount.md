## Variable Amount

Amounts used with inputs can either be configured to remain fixed
(except for inflation), or to change over time.

A variable amount is used if the value needs to change over time. For example, some expenses may [decrease after retirement][exampleRetirementReduceExpenses], such as gasoline for commuting. Similarly, the amount for [employment income][employmentIncomeExample] may reduce to zero after retirement.

Even if the amount isn't expected to change over time, variable 
amounts can also be used to setup a list of named values
which can be quickly selected from in different [scenarios][scenario].
