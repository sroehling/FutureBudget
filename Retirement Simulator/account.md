# Account Input

Account inputs represent various types of savings and investment accounts,
such as regular savings, 401Ks, or Roth IRAs.

All account inputs have a __Current Balance__, 
__Investment/Return Rate__. Accounts also have a __Withdrawal Priority__, which 
determines an account's relative order for withdrawals. Regular 
contributions can also be set up for any account, including a 
__Contribution Amount__ and repeat frequency.

Account inputs are different in the way withdrawals are limited, contributions are taxed, 
withdrawals are taxed, or interest (returns) are taxed. For example, the interest on regular savings
taxed as income, the contributions to a [401K][2] are tax deductable, but withdrawals from a Roth IRA
are not taxed.
