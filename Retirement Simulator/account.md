# Account Input

Account inputs represent various types of savings and investment accounts,
such as [regular savings][1], [401Ks][2], or [Roth IRAs][5].

All account inputs have a __Current Balance__, 
__Investment/Return Rate__. Accounts also have a __Withdrawal Priority__, which 
determines an account's relative order for withdrawals. Regular 
contributions can also be set up for any account, including a 
__Contribution Amount__ and repeat frequency.

Account inputs are different in the way withdrawals are limited, contributions are taxed, 
withdrawals are taxed, or interest (returns) are taxed. For example, the interest on [regular savings][1]
taxed as income, the contributions to a [401K][2] are tax deductable, but withdrawals from a [Roth IRA][5]
are not taxed.
