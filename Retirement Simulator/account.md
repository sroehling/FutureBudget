## Account Input

Account inputs represent various types of savings and investment accounts,
such as [regular savings][exampleRegularSavings], [401Ks][example401K], or [Roth IRAs][exampleRoth].

All account inputs have a __Current Balance__, 
__Investment/Return Rate__. Accounts also have a __Withdrawal Priority__, which 
determines an account's relative order for withdrawals. Regular 
contributions can also be set up for any account, including a 
__Contribution Amount__ and repeat frequency.

Account inputs are different in the way withdrawals are limited, contributions are taxed, 
withdrawals are taxed, or interest (returns) are [taxed][tax]. For example, the interest on [regular savings][exampleRegularSavings]
taxed as income, the contributions to a [401Ks][example401K] are tax deductable, but withdrawals from a [Roth IRA][exampleRoth]
are not taxed.
