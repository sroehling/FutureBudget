## Retirement Examples

### Expected Retirement Date

Creating a 
a [milestone date][milestone] named "Expected Retirement" is suggested. Multiple inputs can then select this same milestone date as a stop date, such as [employment income][employmentIncomeExample] or employment related expenses. If the expected retirement date changes, all the inputs which have selected this milestone will also change.

To setup the milestone, a retirement related input should first be selected. For example, the __Stop Date__ for income would be changed to reflect the expected
retirement date, as follows:

1. Go to the __Inputs__ tab

2. Select the appropriate income input. 

3. Select this input's __Stop Date__. 

4. Tap the __Edit__ button.

5. While in edit mode, tap the add button to create the new "Expected Retirement" milestone date.

6. When done creating the milestone date, tap the __Done__ button.

7. Select this new milestone date instead of the default retirement date.

8. In other retirement related inputs, also select the milestone date as a stop date.


### Reducing Expenses

While certain employment related expenses may stop altogether after retirement, others such as gasoline, dry cleaning, or dining out may decrease after retirement. 

To represent these decreased expenses, a [variable amount][variableAmount] would be used, where the starting value is the pre-retirement amount, but there is a decrease in the amount after the retirement date.

### Invest More Conservatively After Retirement

Similar to the way certain expense amounts may reduce after retirement, the expected rate of return for investment accounts may decrease after retirement. In other words, after retirement, you might accept a lesser rate of return in return decreased risk of heavy losses.

To represent the a low expected rate of return, a [variable return rate][variableInterest] is used. The starting value is the expected return rate before retirement, and the return rate changes to a smaller percentage value after the expected retirement date.

### Retiring Early

To make changes to input values without impacting
the default results, a new [alternate scenario][scenario] named "Early Retirement"
is created then selected as the current scenario. 

This scenario can be created by going to the scenario list in the 
__What If__ tab. After adding the new scenario, the "Early Retirement" scenario is then selected it as the current scenario, so further changes 
to input values will be saved under this scenario.

Similar to the [milestone date][milestone] for the expected retirement date, setting up another milestone date called "Early Retirement Date" is suggested. Similar to setting up a milestone date for the expected retirement (see above), the dates for appropriate input would select this "Early Retirement Date" milestone when the "Early Retirement" scenario is selected.

After selecting the "Early Retirement" scenario, the dates and amounts for retirement related inputs are changed as appropriate.
